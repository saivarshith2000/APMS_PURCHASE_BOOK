Note on performance of TransactionHelper

You may notice that everytime the addNewTransaction function is called
transactionsArray is sorted. This is unavoidable as that array is built from
an object. I have decided to use an object instead of array as it is more performant query wise.
But this structure is less performant for insert and modify tasks. But this is a tradeoff that 
does not cause much issue as the case where an element is inserted anywhere but the last is rare.
We have to sort the array everytime becase js objects do not retain their key ordering on storage.
They are stored randomly and different browsers and devices read them differently, so on converting to array
they must be sorted based on the date
